U+:new health variant
U:old health variant

Crosshairs have to be adjusted in order to do this go into scripts/hudlayout.res. Find the crosshair you want and change the xpos and ypos untill you are satisfied.

In order to change the scoreboards go into resources/ui you should see scoreboard.res and scoreboardhighlander6s.res change the name of "scoreboarhighlander6s" to "scoreboard" and the default to "scorboardoriginal".

The U hud variant is now inside the new resources/ui directory, the file is labeled hudplayerhealthU.res. To use this change the file name to hudplayerhealth.res and change the original to a different name or delete it.
currently optimized for 16:9 and 16:10
